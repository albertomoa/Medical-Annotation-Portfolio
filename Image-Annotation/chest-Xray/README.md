# Chest X-ray Annotation ‚Äì Pneumonia Detection

## Project Overview

This project involves manual image annotation of chest X-ray images for abnormal findings such as **pneumonia opacities**. The goal is to simulate how radiographic data can be used in machine learning pipelines for diagnosis support.

This project is part of my [Medical Annotation Portfolio](../..), and demonstrates my ability to annotate medical images using industry tools.
